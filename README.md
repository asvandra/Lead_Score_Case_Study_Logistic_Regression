# Lead_Score_Case_Study_Logistic_Regression

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
➢ X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. X Education needs help in selecting the most promising leads, i.e., the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.
➢ The company needs a model wherein you a lead score is assigned to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
➢ The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%. 
## Objective:
➢ Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
➢ There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well.
